                <h3>High Street Retail & Mall</h3>
                <p>Retail cooperative society:This is established and managed by a voluntary group of retailers in order to make goods readily are valuable to members at reduced price. The members pool their resources together in order to purchase in back and then sell the goods at reduced price to members.</p>

                <h3> Security System</h3>
                <p>In big cities, community living is more common than living in independent houses. It is because a closed campus offers a more security. Nowadays, the builders provide a higher level of security like CCTV camera installed everywhere, fire fighting equipment, video door phone and intercom facilities. Make sure your housing facility provides 24*7 securities with guards stationed at all times at the entrance doors.</p>

                <h3>Social Infrastructure:</h3>
                <p>As the distance between eh areas and the traffic on roads are increasing, it is getting difficult to go to the shops for buying the basic necessities. Make sure that the builder provides amenities like supermarket and multi utility stores that can help in fulfilling your daily needs. </p>
